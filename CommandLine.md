### 1.1 Open Terminal

On Mac

3) Open the Terminal app.

### 1.2 Show the directory (folder) you are currently located in

~~~shell
pwd
~~~


### 1.3 List files in current directory

~~~shell
ls
~~~

### 1.4 Navigate to the folder that contains the sound files you want to work with

~~~shell
cd ~/Desktop/archive
~~~
