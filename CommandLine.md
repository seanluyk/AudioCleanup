### 1.2 Show the directory (folder) you are currently working in
- In <b>Terminal</b> type:
~~~shell
pwd
~~~

- This <i>prints</i> your current working directory. It is like map ("You are HERE") that shows you where you are located in your file system at a given moment.
- The pwd command is useful because when working with files in Terminal, you need to give the computer instructions based on your current location.
- It will return something like this:

### 1.3 List files in current directory
- In <b>Terminal</b> type:
~~~shell
ls
~~~
- This <i>lists</i> the files in the folder where you are located.
- You can even see "hidden" files by typing "ls -a"

### 1.4 Navigate to the folder that contains the sound files you want to work with
- In <b>Terminal</b> type:
~~~shell
cd ~/Desktop/SoX-Archive
~~~
- This changes directory or <i>moves</i> you into a new folder using the directions you provide.
- You can also move up one level by typing "cd .."
- You can also navigate to the previous directory (i.e. go back) by typing "cd -"

### 1.5 List files in the archive folder
- In <b>Terminal</b> type:
~~~shell
ls
~~~
- Now you should see the files in our corpus.

### 1.6 Rename file
- In <b>Terminal</b> type:
~~~shell
mv bbc_rain---rai_nhu0506113 rain.wav
~~~
- This command is used to <i>rename</i> and <i>move</i> files.
- The file is now named "rain.wav" (much easier to remember!)

**TIP: To automatically insert the file name/path, click and drag the file from Finder into Terminal.

- You can also <i>copy</i> files by typing "cp [file name/path] [new path]"
- You can then <i>delete</i> the file by typing "rm [file name/path]"

  
### 1.7 Create folder
- In <b>Terminal</b> type:
~~~shell
mkdir soundfx
~~~
- This <i>creates a new folder</i>, which we've named "soundfx"
  
### 1.8 Move files into folder
- In <b>Terminal</b> type:
~~~shell
mv rain.wav /soundfx/rain.wav
~~~
- This <i>moves</i> our sound file called "rain.wav" into the folder "soundfx"
